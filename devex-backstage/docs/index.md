## 📦 Project Structure

The codebase follows a **monorepo** structure with Yarn Workspaces, separating the frontend, backend, and plugins:

```
📂 root
├── 📂 packages          # Internal reusable packages
│   ├── 📂 backend      # Backend code (Node.js)
│   ├── 📂 app          # React application (Frontend)
│   ├── 📂 plugins      # Custom plugins
├── 📂 .github          # GitHub Actions workflows
├── 📜 package.json     # Dependency manager and scripts
├── 📜 yarn.lock        # Dependencies lock file
├── 📜 Dockerfile       # Docker image definition
└── 📜 README.md        # You're here! 📘
```

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (`20.x` or `22.x`)
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** (`4.4.1`)
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** (optional but recommended)

## 💻 Installation and Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
yarn install
```

Create a **`.env`** file in the root directory and configure the environment variables:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

The project uses **Yarn Workspaces** to manage packages. Key commands include:

### 🚀 Start

- **Start frontend and backend in parallel:**  
  ```sh
  yarn dev
  ```
- **Start only the frontend:**  
  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```
- **Start only the backend:**  
  ```sh
  yarn start-backend
  ```

### 🏗️ Build

- **Build the backend:**  
  ```sh
  yarn build:backend
  ```
- **Build the entire project:**  
  ```sh
  yarn build:all
  ```
- **Generate Docker image:**  
  ```sh
  yarn build-image
  ```

### 🎨 Code Quality

- **Run lint:**  
  ```sh
  yarn lint
  ```
- **Auto-fix lint issues:**  
  ```sh
  yarn fix
  ```
- **Check formatting with Prettier:**  
  ```sh
  yarn prettier:check
  ```

### 🧪 Testing

- **Run all tests:**  
  ```sh
  yarn test
  ```
- **Run tests with coverage:**  
  ```sh
  yarn test:all
  ```
- **Run E2E tests with Playwright:**  
  ```sh
  yarn test:e2e
  ```

yarn start          # Frontend (React)
```

To ensure a properly formatted code:

```sh
yarn lint
yarn fix
```

yarn test
```

### 📌 Running tests with coverage:

```sh
yarn test:all
```

### 📌 End-to-end (E2E) tests:

```sh
yarn test:e2e
```

To run **E2E** tests in headless mode:

```sh
yarn test:e2e --headless
```
